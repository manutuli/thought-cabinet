# Thought-cabinet
A simple interface inspired by my favourite video game.

### User page
  - Display funny descriptions.
  - Internalize thoughts.
  - Gain bonuses from internalized thoughts.
  - progress and complete thought.
  - Forget internalized thoughts.

### Admin page (uncomment "form-feature" lines in components)
  - Create a new thought.
  - update any thought.
  - Delete any thought.
  - Delete all the cabinet.

## Graphic design
  - CSS colors for each thought.
  - bootstrap

## Constraints and dependencies
  - Vanilla JS App.
  - State Management System.
  - accessibility.
  - use LocalStorage.
  - use JSDocs.

## planning
  - sprint 1 : user page dom nodes.
  - sprint 2 : state management.
  - sprint 3 : score.
  - sprint 4 : role based authentication.

## test cases 
  - Given there are thoughts in the list,
  - When a thought in the list is clicked,
  - It shows the data of the thought.
